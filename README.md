# About this project
This is a quick, small project on capturing BLE data from a Xiaomi Mijia 2 hygrometer-thermometer. It was intended as a way to get some practice with the rust programming language and also ended up being a good first look into BLE communication.

This project originated a [blog post](https://dev.to/lcsfelix/using-rust-blurz-to-capture-bluetooth-messages-9f-temp-slug-3838740?preview=259783675da772c58dae7c7ec5e06fd3e9746205826a13f6c39fcdefba2e37713113f2b21f1aeade314f556d37c2bc59e2c0b128499dd616d3622327) and the [devto-post](https://github.com/lcsfelix/reading-xiaomi-temp/tree/devto-post) branch contains the companion code to that blog post.

I hope to soon update this master branch with a finalized, less _tutorialized_ version of the code.
