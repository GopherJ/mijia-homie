# About this project

This is a project for capturing BLE data from a Xiaomi Mijia 2
hygrometer-thermometer. It includes a simple utility to dump data to standard
output  for testing, and a tool to publish it to an MQTT server following the
[Homie convention](https://homieiot.github.io/).

The project originated from a
[blog post](https://dev.to/lcsfelix/using-rust-blurz-to-capture-bluetooth-messages-9f-temp-slug-3838740?preview=259783675da772c58dae7c7ec5e06fd3e9746205826a13f6c39fcdefba2e37713113f2b21f1aeade314f556d37c2bc59e2c0b128499dd616d3622327),
and some ideas came from a
[Python utility for talking to the same sensors](https://github.com/JsBergbau/MiTemperature2),
especially [this issue thread](https://github.com/JsBergbau/MiTemperature2/issues/1).
